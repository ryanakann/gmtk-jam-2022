Me and the boys just learning some Godot, you know how it is.

## Theme
Rolling the Dice

## Game Idea

A-B gameplay loop

Platformer. Player is standing on an auto-generated simplistic course (like an endless runner I guess). There are various jumps scattered between platforms.

A: Literally roll giant physical dice from a birds eye/askew view, maybe with bonuses for snake eyes and shit if we have time. Control general direction and power with a toss or a golf-esque meter.
B: Take over your character, and attempt to get across the gap with the die platforms you made
